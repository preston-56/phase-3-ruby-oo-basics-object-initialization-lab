# Object Initialization

## Learning Goals

- Learn about the `#initialize` method
- Use `#initialize` to set attributes when an instance is created

## Introduction

We've already seen new instances of classes being created with the `#new`
method. For example:

```ruby
class Dog
  attr_accessor :breed
end

snoopy = Dog.new # => #<Dog:0x007f970a2edfd0>
```

The code above creates a new instance of the `Dog` class and sets that object
equal to a variable, `snoopy`. If we want to give our dog a breed, we have to
use the following code:

```ruby
snoopy = Dog.new # => #<Dog:0x007f970a2edfd0>
snoopy.breed # => nil
snoopy.breed = "Beagle"
snoopy.breed # => "Beagle"
```

However, most dogs are born _with_ a breed, not assigned a breed afterwards. How
can we model the behavior of dogs being born with a breed in our `Dog` class? If
only there was a way for us to assign an individual dog a breed automatically
upon creation, or instantiation.

Lucky for us, there is! It's called the `#initialize` method.

## The `#initialize` Method

We already know that any Ruby class can produce new instances of itself, via the
`<Class Name>.new` method, whether or not that class has an `#initialize`
method. However, if we want each instance of our class to be created with
certain data, we must define an `#initialize` method.

The `#initialize` method is a method that is called _automatically_ whenever
`.new` is used.

Let's define an `#initialize` method that takes in an argument of a dog's breed
and sets a `@breed` variable equal to that argument. In other words, let's
define our `#initialize` method to contain the functionality of the `#breed=`
method, so that a dog instance will get a breed assigned to it right away when
it is created, without us having to explicitly use the `#breed=` method.

```ruby
class Dog
  attr_reader :breed

  def initialize(breed)
    @breed = breed
  end

end
```

Now, we can call `.new` like this:

```ruby
lassie = Dog.new("Collie")

lassie.breed # => "Collie"
```

When `.new` is called, Ruby will automatically invoke the `#initialize` method
and forward the argument (or arguments) from `.new` to `#initialize`.

**Note**: In the code above, we are now using the `attr_reader` macro instead of
the `attr_accessor` macro because we are setting the value of the `@breed`
attribute inside our `#initialize` method. This means we are not able to change
the value of `@breed` after it's initially set. In some cases this is desirable,
but if we want to be able to change the value of an attribute later, we would
use the `attr_accessor` macro **in addition to** `#initialize`.

If you’re familiar with Object Oriented JavaScript from previous experience, you
may be curious about what this Ruby syntax looks like when translated to
JavaScript. If you’re not, no worries — just know that most of the OO features
we’re discussing in Ruby are possible in JavaScript too!

The `#initialize` method is similar to the constructor method in JavaScript:

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(breed) {
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}

const lassie = new Dog("Collie");
lassie.breed; // => "Collie"
```

### Instructions

Fork and clone the lab and run the tests with `learn test`.

### 1. `Person#initialize` with a Name

Define a `Person` class in `lib/person.rb`. In the class, define an
`#initialize` method that accepts an argument for the person's name. That
argument should be stored within a `@name` instance variable.

### 2. `Dog#initialize` with Name and Breed defaulting to "Mutt"

Define a `Dog` class in `lib/dog.rb`. In the class, define an `#initialize`
method that accepts an argument for the dog's name. That argument should be
stored within a `@name` instance variable.

Additionally, `Dog#initialize` should accept a second _optional_ argument for
the dog's breed stored in an instance variable `@breed`. When no breed is
provided, it should default to "Mutt".
